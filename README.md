# Ninja Fighter [Prototype]
### A project by Jarten

**This readme is outdated! I havent gotten around to updating it just yet, but crucial details is that I use ggez and bevy_ecs now, and am still working on the engine.**

This project is a means to really dive head first into a new game dev experience, where I can learn to build a game from the ground up.
Unlike the last game engine I built myself, I'm making this one in Rust. Trying to get things to even render with Python was a mess.
~~This project uses [https://github.com/hecrj/coffee](coffee) to do the super heavy lifting, handing off direct GPU control, but otherwise the rest of the functionality is handled by me.~~

Currently in prototyping phase, where I build the bare minimum and try to get something working. Also known as a Minimum Viable Product, or similar. 
Reach out if you have anything to say about this!
