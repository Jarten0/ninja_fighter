    Oh but here's an option!
        *SEQUENCE_TWO. This leads to a new sequence, but "SEQUENCE_TWO. " is ommitted.
        *SEQUENCE_DEAD[death_flag = arrows]. You can have more than two options, and even pass flags to each sequence.
        *SEQUENCE_ONE. Or just have a recursive path that maybe leads back to where you started.
        *This one doesn't have a path, and continues the sequence
    
    This line will show up only if the fourth is picked



    #cool_item==3.2
        This is where you can write new statements
            *And add options

SEQUENE_TWO
    All sequences are to be UPPERCASE_SNAKE, as to be distinct.
    In sequences, you can store data whenever using this.
    (keypad:bool = true)
    (cool_item:f=3.2)
    This will create a new "variable" that can be accessed wherever in the document.

SEQUENCE_DEAD[death_flag: string]
    (if death flag is arrows):
        You just write the specific death text here
        (death_log:string="you died to arrows") assign variables too


    And then be more general and unspecific here,
    Where this will show up regardless of how you died
